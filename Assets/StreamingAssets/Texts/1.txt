| "Pusoth!" said the green, muscular ogre, whose face was full of worry and very flushed. I looked at him with a hint of disgust but I still... had a weird feeling in my stomach.
"What do you want, Shrek"
"I... I am so sorry for this" as he ran towards me.
His big lips were moisturized with his nervous green sweat, that smelled like butterflies and garbage. Hot goddamn I thought in my mind. The moisturized lips touched my lips, with a hint of horniness.
It was the exact feeling I had before. I think I'm in love with this garbage smelling ogre, that makes my bone hurt too much and get my tail go woozy. 
"S-Shrek...." I moaned. |
